function [ outptlist , filterParams ] = filterByNN( ptlist )
%filterByNN Takes an input set of points and filters out the ones that
%don't fit into a grid-like scheme.
%   INPUT:  ptlist - Nx2 array or [x,y] row vectors. It is assumed that
%               there is enough consistency that the regularity of the map
%               can be extracted.
